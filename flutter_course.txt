	a) Creating an App Theme
		For a consistent theme across pages/activities of your app. Requires a *ThemeData*

	b) Update certain parts of the theme:
		theme:ThemeData.dark().copyWith(
			primaryColor: Color(0xFF0A0E21)
			scaffoldBackgroundColor: Color(0xFF0A0E21)
		)

	c) For more granular control over the Theme for particular widgets, we can wrap the widgets in a *Theme Widget* and provide the ThemeData to *data:*.

	d) The main.dart generally contains a lot of theming and nothing else.

	e) For evenly spaced widgets, use the *Expanded* widget.

	f) You can *extract widget* from Flutter Outline to create a custom widget.

	g) Stateless widgets are immutable. Therefore *final* or *const* has to be used for its properties. *const* is a compile-time property and it cannot grasp run-time properties (like number of times button clicked).
	Basically a const variable HAS to be initialised, however that's not the case with *final*.
